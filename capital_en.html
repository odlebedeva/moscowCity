 <div class="tower-description">
  "City of capitals" is an admirable architectural complex. Composed of two high-rise buildings: "Moscow" and "St. Petersburg", he emphasizes the power and steadfastness of Russia, the country's desire to develop and cooperate with other countries of the world. 
  The architecture of each of the towers is impressive: the houses consist of blocks that are offset relative to each other.  <br>It consists of two levels. The lower level is a glazed gallery throughout. On the lower level are installed horizontal travolators for the convenience of walking at this level. The upper level is partly glazed, there is an open observation deck on it.
 <br> In the construction of the skyscrapers was used the principle of the "air foundation". If you look at the building, you will see that it consists of cubes. They are unevenly on top of each other. This is not just an original architectural solution.
 Each of the "cubes" has its own foundation, which on special elements - outriggers is based on the core of rigidity, thereby supporting the following. In simple terms, these cubes hold reinforced concrete structures that serve to distribute the load from the upper floors to a peculiar hardness framework-the core.
 They give buildings additional stability. Skyscrapers, to test stability under wind loads, underwent a special survey: the design of the project on a reduced scale was "blown out" in special laboratories. "Air Cubes" is the "highlight" of the building.
 <br> In the "City of Capitals" are installed two-storey elevators of the Double Deck series. They have twin lift, upper lift- for passenger and lower lift- for cargo. The advantage of such elevators is that in one shaft in fact there are two elevators of different purposes. Nowhere else in the business center of "Moscow City" there are no such elevators.
 The windows passed crash tests. You can bump them with your hand, leg, furniture - they do not beat. This triplex double glazed windows, tempered glass, plus there is an additional film coating.
